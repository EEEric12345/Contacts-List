# Contacts-List
## APCSA 2023 Sem1 Final Project
Create a program that will keep track of all your contacts. Each Person will have the following member variables: name prefix, name, middle name, last name, name suffix, nickname, phone number (can store multiple), emails (can store multiple), groups, address (can store multiple), important dates (ex. birthday), relationship, and notes. Not all member variables may be filled, similar to a real contacts list. Similar to a contact list on your phone you should be able to add new contacts, change/update the information of existing contacts, and search for a person. When you enter a search all contacts that have a match somewhere in their information should be shown.
